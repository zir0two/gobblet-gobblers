# gobblet-gobblers

Hello!

This is my version of the board game Gobblet Gobblers!

This is an old project I have done in a previous class, but I wanted to add it here as it was so interesting to implement.

The game is like tic-tac-toe but now incorporate sized pieces and you get Gobblet Gobblers. There are small, medium, 
and large pieces, and the larger pieces can "eat" the smaller pieces. I used linked list to keep track of the board 
throughout the game and implemented a undo function so the player can re-do their last turn. The game is really fun 
if you have not played it either online or physically.
